# Project WeatherApp

## Description

This is a simple weather Android app. It gets the information by the API call with given location. [Openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/) web site allows to get a JSON data with weather informations for given location. App turns JSON into readable information and shows it to the user.

This project is a documentation of my learning process about API calling and JSON parsing. It is one of many challenges from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-android-n-developer-course/) in which I participate.

If you can see some drama, some obvious bug or some bad habit tell me! I would be very glad if you do. It is all about learning.

It is an Android Studio project, so if you want to run it you should import it as a new project in your IDE and compile it.
